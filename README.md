# OOP_FinalProject_PaintAPP
Final Project for my Object-Oriented Programming

For my project i used a javafx for designing my GUI, and a scenebuilder.

NOTE: for the Import java.embed.swing.SwingFXUtils it doesn't work very well because the new Update, it removes the import embed
so what i did is i downloaded someone's code and i put it in a new folder inside the java folder inside the src (src\java\javafx.embed.swing)
